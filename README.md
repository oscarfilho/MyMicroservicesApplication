### Authentication:
I used Json Web Token with public/private key signature (RSA256) to keep the users authenticated [RFC doc](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).

First, SPA retrieve from the authentication service an access token. It'll be expire in one week (7 days).
Every hour and every time the user open the web application a new token will be retrieved from the token renew endpoint.
This strategy seems acceptable for a web application. 

Initial incpit from this [discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26739167/jwt-json-web-token-automatic-prolongation-of-expiration/26834685#26834685).

### Database:
I use MySQL to keep users informations running on the 'db' container with a mapping volume on the host machine.

dotnet-ef migrations to database versioning.

### Requirements:
For each aspnet core service you may need to restore packages:
```sh
$ dotnet restore
```
And build the project:
```sh
$ dotnet publish
```
You have to generate a private/public keys for JWT:
```sh
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
```
```sh
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```
See this [link](https://rietta.com/blog/2012/01/27/openssl-generating-rsa-key-from-command/)

Place the private and public keys in the 'keys' folder into the services base folder.
The private key is needed only by the authorization service.

And generate the HTTPS certificate:
```sh
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.crt
```
See this [link](https://www.ssl.com/how-to/create-a-pfx-p12-certificate-file-using-openssl/)

Install this certificate in your dev computer.

Setup AWS credentials into a file (MyMicroservicesApplication\Services\Orders\Orders.Application\aws.dev\credentials): [Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html)

For Authorization, Orders and Catalog services you need to initialize the mySQL schema. Use the dotnet utility for each service, type the following commands from the project folders:
```sh
dotnet ef database -v update
```

### How to run the solution:
```sh
$ docker-compose -c docker-compose.dev.yml build
```
```sh
$ docker-compose -c docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
or build run and detach
```sh
$ docker-compose -c docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
```
Navigate to http://your-docker-host-name-or-ip/

### Notes about the frontend:
The frontend is a single page application built by angular-cli, I changed the ng serve command in the package.json file to accept two configuration:

.1 Run the webpack-dev-server with a local backend services (ex. if you want to debug a service locally with the frontend as client). Configure the proxy with the desired redirects for the routes, for example I want to debug the login page using the authorization service run locally:
```json
  {
    "/api/token": {
        "target": "https://localhost:443",
        "secure": false,
        "changeOrigin": true,
        "logLevel": "debug"
    }
  }
```
(proxy.config.local.json)
```sh
$ npm run start
```
.2 Or run the webpack-dev-server with the backend run on the docker host
```sh
$ npm run start-docker
```
(see proxy.config.docker.json)

Others options are the same from angular-cli [docs](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

### How to debug a remote container:
For example, to debug the auth_service: look at the Dockerfile.debug version. I added the sshd support. Then you can attach remotely over a ssh tunnel with your ide. Notes the port mapping '2222:22' to avoid conflicts with the host's ssh server.

Use the correct version of docker-compose file to overwrite the configurations, like:
```sh
$ docker-compose -c docker-compose.dev.yml -c docker-compose.debug.yml up --build -d
```
Execute, on the docker host the ssh server of the container
```sh
$ docker exec -it <container-id> "/usr/sbin/sshd"  
```
Copy the ssh key to the docker container, look into the 'scripts' folder. Remember that you can reach the ssh server of the container through the docker-host port mapped (2222 in this case).
```sh
$ ssh-copy-id -p 2222 -i your_public_key.pub -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" root@<docker-host-ip>
```
If you are using vs code, you can now use the launch.json settings to attach to the remote container and select the correct process (example configuration).
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [  
    {
        "name": ".NET Core Remote Attach",
        "type": "coreclr",
        "request": "attach",
        "processId": "${command:pickRemoteProcess}",
        "pipeTransport": {
            "pipeCwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
            "pipeProgram": "ssh",
            "pipeArgs": ["-p", "2222", "-i", "<your-.ssh-path>/id_rsa_clrdbg", "-T", "root@<docker-host-ip>"],
            "debuggerPath": "/root/vsdbg/vsdbg",
            "quoteArgs": true
        },
        "sourceFileMap": {
                "<your-solution-folder>": "${workspaceRoot}"
        }
    }]
}
```
